**Notable** **Cast**: Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons.

**Release** **Year**: 2014.



# **Synopsis** 

Whiplash tells the story of the explosive relationship between young drumming prodigy, Andrew Nieman (Miles Teller), and prestigious Shaffer Conservatory of Music professor, Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons). Andrew Nieman, a first year at Shaffer, desires to be one of the great jazz drummers. Early in the film, Nieman is invited to be the alternate for Fletcher’s band, the most reputable band at Shaffer. Nieman quickly realizes that he must sacrifice everything in order to achieve his goal. The tumultuous relationship between Fletcher and Nieman becomes both emotionally and physically abusive, resulting in catastrophic outcomes.



# **Acting**

Miles Teller is phenomenal in his role as Andrew Nieman. When we meet Teller, he seems to be nice enough, a quiet first year in college. The viewer roots for him as he starts a budding relationship with the girl from the theater as well as when Teller is invited into Simmons’ band. Teller’s performance, which is primarily reactive and shaped by Simmons’ behavior, is insane. I loved how Chazelle uses Teller’s interactions with his girlfriend and his family to show the way he had been molded by Simmons. Whiplash is more than a movie about a drumming prodigy, it is very much a movie about relational abuse and manipulation. Layers man! I geek out for layers in movies. 



I think how Chazelle spaces Teller’s interactions with Simmons by interposing his exchanges with minor characters in between set a really unique and dynamic pace. Since the majority of the film takes place in the classroom, the viewer kind of gets accustomed to Simmons’ abuse. It becomes the point of reference. Then Chazelle balances this false normal by sprinkling in Teller’s interactions with other characters. Maybe I am being too analytical, but I think this was a statement of how abuse eventually transcends to normalcy for victims. I think Chazelle does a wonderful job displaying how real, disastrous, and drastic this tragedy can be.



Conversely, the viewer starts to root against Teller, as his interactions with other characters start to resemble Simmons’ erratic personality. Teller is shaped by Simmons. The drive to be the best drummer becomes a massively destructive force. The breakup with his girlfriend, the dinner conversation with his extended family, and his altercations with fellow drummer, Ryan Connolly, are both prominent and dynamic reference points for Teller’s devolution. It is heartbreaking to watch Teller trample over people with emotional abuse in order to defend his pursuit, which is marred by the cruelty he is suffering from Simmons. The viewer is constantly feeling conflicted if they should feel sympathy or anger for Teller. Chazelle does an amazing job creating a vastly layered and dynamic character, that keeps the viewer engaged. More so, Teller’s acting only supplements Chazelle’s impressive writing.  



The vigorous final performance is phenomenal for a plethora of reasons, most notably the story telling, the acting, and the power struggle. As Simmons’ intentions are revealed, the previous bar interaction between the two characters becomes incredibly layered. More so, the acting throughout this scene continues to be on par for both Teller and Simmons. The part that struck me most was the way Simmons and Teller wrestled dominance from one another throughout the performance. Simmons initially thinks he won after Teller retreats off stage; however, Teller immediately regains his agency by emerging back on stage. More so, Teller begins to challenge Simmons’ control by taking lead of the band, queuing in the other band members. I love me a good ol’ not happy ending. Whiplash surely did not disappoint. As Teller starts to dictate the performance, Simmons readdress his approach and coaches Teller through it. The viewer is left with the uneasy feeling that Teller is not freed from Simmons’ manipulative grasp, but was re-ensnared. Man do I love when things do not wrap up smoothly and the ending is ambiguous - a huge plus for me. I think it is huge if a movie has me considering multiple possibilities after its over. 



J.K. Simmons’ performance in Whiplash is absolutely mental. It is hard to actually process and understand how lights out his performance is. No wonder the guy won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. Simmons displays an extremely wide array of emotions throughout the movie. Most notably, Simmons’ Fletcher is angry, controlling, abusive, explosive, and manipulative; however, Simmons also has a few scenes where he is tender, sweet, and emotionally vulnerable. As a viewer, Simmons acting causes you to feel exhausted and abused. Due to Simmons’ delivery, the viewer is able to sympathize with Teller. After I finished the movie, I felt like I needed a nap. 



I was immediately taken aback by Simmons’ manipulative masterclass after his first interaction with Teller, after Teller is invited to his band. After chatting up Teller before class, Simmons then verbally batters Teller equipping all of Teller’s insecurities, which he had just learned. The jabs about Teller’s mom ‘walking-out’ are especially shocking. Furthermore, Simmons’ performance really twists the knife. The interaction between the two in the “Not Quite My Tempo Scene” could go down in stone. The acting of legend. The raw emotion Teller displays as he is obliterated by the most influential person in his life is believable and painful. Simmons possesses Teller deep in his grasp. More so, the audience is intimidated by Simmons’ power and manipulation. I was extremely uneasy as he forced Teller to scream, “I’m Upset!” time and time again. Simmons’ exposition is simply unconscious. 



The viewer quickly begins to start rooting against Simmons. I felt relief and a sense of justice after Teller agreed to testify against him. My distaste for Simmons grew as I learned that his former student hung himself and was not slain in a car accident. The tense conversation between Simmons and Teller at the jazz club feels extremely uneasy throughout. Simmons is much less explosive during their interaction, but remains in character as he is unapologetic and ruthless. The viewer is shocked when Simmons admits that he does not feel sorry and doubles down by stating he never will apologize for how he chose to motivate his students, even though it resulted in a student killing himself. More so, this callback makes the audience wonder if Simmons’ emotions upon hearing and delivering the news to his students were real or merely contrived. At the end of their conversation, Simmons takes a completely different approach to his interactions with Teller, and offers a peaceful, passive invitation to playing with him at the JVC Jazz Competition. I wanted so badly for Teller to decline the offer, but I knew he would not. I was gutted when Teller decided to go. I think my deep emotional response is further praise for Chazelle’s storytelling and the superb acting from both Teller and Simmons. 



Before the performance at the JVC Jazz Competition, Simmons states that that performance had the potential to either make or break the many musicians’ careers, foreshadowing his own mal-intentions. Simmons’ true motive of inviting Teller, to ruin his career, is quickly revealed when he announced that the band would play a song fully unfamiliar to Teller. Next, Simmons confronts Teller, telling him he knew it was Teller who was behind the lawsuit. The viewer is shocked by how manipulative and abusive Simmons continued to be even after losing his job. The way Chazelle ties the jazz bar conversation into the true purpose of the JVC competition is remarkable. Chazelle’s story telling leads up to a massive climax, which had me extremely engaged. It was tremendously captivating watching as Simmons’ intentions were revealed and watching Teller’s response. A fantastic, uneasy, unclear ending. Kisses to the chef.



# **Cinematography** 

Whiplash is a well-rounded movie but lacks in one key category. Cinematography. Whiplash is a great movie due to unbelievable directing and acting. However, since I really value good cinematography, Whiplash was not able to break into the 9s. The fantastic acting and story blew me away, but the movie did not have the entire package. There were few scenes, from a technical perspective, throughout the movie that struck me as beautiful and impressive. The scene where Teller ices his bloody hand as well as when he approaches the JVC Jazz Competition are the only two scenes that struck me for how they were shot and created. The cinematography alone is the only part of the movie that is not excellent. 



# **Final Consensus**



Whiplash is an amazing movie, which I would highly recommend watching if you’re a sucker for movies that solely rely on acting and character dynamics. Chazelle creates some amazing characters with a plethora of layers. Like an onion! More so, the acting from Teller and Simmons, especially, is nothing short of an absolute masterclass. I do not think there was one point where I felt as if a scene was under-performed or overacted. Whiplash scored an 8.9 from me because it did not seem, to me, to be the full package. Yes, the acting, directing, and storytelling were magnificent; however, the movie, from a technical side, seemed a bit vanilla to me.
