## Plot

Jojo Rabbit tells an enthralling story of an innocent, young German boy who is desperate for love and approval. Placed in Germany during the waning days of the Second World War, the viewer follows Jojo’s journey, who is always accompanied by his imaginary friend, the Führer. Jojo’s innocence is displayed through his mother tying his shoes. Furthermore, Jojo’s longing nature is enforced by Jojo’s father’s absence at home, which causes Jojo to cling to imaginary Hitler for approval. Jojo often tries to find acceptance in being a dedicated member of the Hitler Youth; however, this aim is ultimately challenged when he is confronted by the Jewish girl, Elsa, living in the attic.

After Jojo’s injury at the Hitler Youth retreat, he begins to spend more time with his mother, Rosie. The viewer is quickly made aware of Rosie’s love for her son as well as her active rebellion against the Nazis. More so, while spending more time at home, Jojo is frequently challenged by Elsa. Jojo is shown as a pure child, who is merely stuck in unfortunate circumstances, which results in his adopting of Nazi ideals, in his biking adventure with Rosie as well as when Rosie dressed up as Jojo’s father during dinner. Jojo laughs and is joyous, void of Nazi ideology.

Jojo Rabbit does a phenomenal job of blending comedy and drama around a devastating subject, as it comedically touches on Hitler’s war of racism and extermination. In my opinion, Waititi uses comedy to display his disapproval and abhorrence for the Holocaust. Through comedic exaggerations, Waititi shows the ridiculous tenants of Nazi ideology. Waititi playfully addresses the extreme racism harbored by Nazi Germany towards the Jews. The general aloof and idiotic personality of Hitler keeps the movie light and the viewer laughing. I was brought to deep belly laughs multiple times throughout the movie due to Waititi’s Hitler. More so, Waititi plays at and utilizes the absurd practices of Nazi Germany. There are two key scenes where a plethora of “Sieg Heil’s,” are shouted in a limited time frame. The viewer cannot help but laugh, but also feels convicted. I believe that Waititi does this to get across the severity of preventing another genocide. Waititi often uses Jojo’s friend, Yorki, for comedic relief. Furthermore, Waititi introduces Yorki at seamless times that deescalates the narrative as well as providing a comedic exposition of the end of the war in Germany.

Jojo Rabbit is further aided by the deep emotional pangs created throughout the story. Most notably, the death of Rosie, the death of Klenzendorf, and Jojo’s reconciliation with Elsa. Jojo Rabbit is excellent because it succeeds both as a comedy and a drama. Whereas I was brought to belly laughter from Waititi acting, I was also brought to tears by his writing. The viewer’s heart is ripped out of their chest as we see Jojo battle traumatic event after traumatic event.

Waititi’s resolution displays that real character change occurred; however, the stakes were high, and the journey was difficult. Jojo’s journey was not easy, and his progress feels earned. Jojo enters the movie as a lonely, innocent, little boy desperate for love. But, Jojo leaves as a resolute young man. Waititi beautifully wraps up Jojo’s arc, as well as the movie, as Jojo ties Elsa’s shoes as she leaves the home for the first time.

## Acting

Roman Griffin Davis’ performance in Jojo Rabbit is nothing short of excellent. Davis displays a wide range of emotions as he is challenged by a plethora of different demanding circumstances. More so, Davis excellently exemplifies the role of the war orphan. Lost, confused, aimless, hurt. Jojo travels through many stages throughout the adventure, such as a radical, a scared child, a momma’s boy, a boyhood friend, a lover, and ultimately a caregiver. Waititi’s writing as well as Davis’ acting result in the fantastic evolution of Davis’ character. There are multiple character defining moments that our young Jojo faces throughout his chaotic trials. At each juncture (Jojo’s failure to kill the rabbit, the exploding grenade, meeting Elsa, witnessing his dead mother, befriending Elsa, being dismissed by Klenzendorf, and ultimately freeing Elsa) the transition is believable, heart wrenching, and does not feel forced. Waititi evokes deep empathy from the viewer as we see Rosie die, Klenzendorf die, and Jojo’s constantly evolving relationship with Elsa. At the end of the film, Jojo’s character has completely changed, and it makes sense. It feels natural. In an iconic scene, Jojo shuts the door to his past ideals and embraces his transformation as he yells, “fuck off Hitler!”

Scarlett Johansson’s performance in this film is simply superb. Personally, I thought Johansson deserved to win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. The endearing relationship between mother and son frequently engages the viewer on a deep emotional level. Whereas the German accent initially seemed odd for anyone who has seen Johansson in any other role, it quickly becomes normal. Johansson does a phenomenal job acting as both a mother who passionately loves her son and is actively engaged in fighting for social justice. When confronting Rockwell, Johansson displays her agency. Even though she is a woman in Nazi Germany, Johansson possesses agency and influence. Waititi masterfully uses dialogue between Rosie and Elsa to display Rosie’s loving and nurturing spirit.

Thomasin McKenzie expertly plays the role of a Jew hiding during the Holocaust. McKenzie is jaded, terrified, and slow to trust, which is logical given her circumstances. However, McKenzie is multi-dimensional, not solely jaded, as she displays deep emotions. McKenzie is broken by the immeasurable losses she has faced at the hands of the Nazis. Moreover, McKenzie is moved by Jojo’s genuine and thoughtful attempts to love and care for her through writing the faux letters. McKenzie’s character is immensely dynamic, which displays her impressive acting range. When confronted by the SS, McKenzie is forced to play the role of Jojo’s sister. The viewer can palpably feel the fear and rigid tensions of the confrontation due to Waititi’s execution and McKenzie’s performance. The viewer is brought to the edge of their seat, as they believe McKenzie’s capture is imminent. Even though it may not have happened historically, the bullying / big sister attitude that McKenzie displays towards Davis is both humorous and stirring. The viewer feels joyous and victorious when we see McKenzie finally freed.

Sam Rockwell is often used as comedic relief. As someone who has only seen Rockwell in serious roles (Three Billboard and Vice) it was a change for sure. “A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.” The slight homosexual implications between Rockwell and Alfie Allen are hilarious and another great example of Waititi’s undermining of Nazi ideals. Again, the ludicrous costume that Rockwell ‘rocks’ in the final battle is likewise multi-purposed. However, Rockwell executes well in the few dramatic scenes he is part of. The viewer is brought to love Rockwell when he vouches for Elsa even though she incorrectly stated the birthday on the passport. More so, it is painful to watch Rockwell dismiss Davis as he is at rock bottom and desperately seeking comfort and security. But the viewer is imbued with well-deserved admiration for Rockwell as it is made clear he saved Davis from the firing squad.

Waititi’s Hitler is the ultimate example of Jojo Rabbit’s duality. I remember laughing multiple times in the opening scene because of Waititi’s Hitler, and I was not sure if I should feel bad about it or not. Waititi is often used as both comedic relief and a measurement for Davis’ character arc. Waititi did not do any research on Hitler before taking the role, which I believe also shows his protest and disapproval of the Holocaust. By totally missing the real characteristics of the Historical Hitler, Waititi exemplifies his denunciation of Hitler. Think about it, how offended would Hitler be if he saw Waititi’s rendition? Personally, I love that Waititi casts himself in his own movies. Korg is one of the best parts of Thor Ragnarök, as is Hitler in Jojo Rabbit.

## Cinematography

As a cinematography snob, Jojo won such a high rating from me because of how well and uniquely it is shot. I’ll list a couple examples that blew me away.
* The foreshadowing and callback of Rosie tying Jojo’s shoes and then Jojo tying Elsa’s shoes.
*While Jojo and Rosie are riding their bikes through the country, Waititi expertly frames the scene by placing the two at the top of the screen while giving a wide shot of the grass.
* The scene of Jojo finding Rosie dead is one of the most impressive and layered scenes I have seen in a while. First of all, just the emotional rollercoaster that scene drags you through. You start with a happy Jojo following a butterfly, then Waititi stomps on your heart as you see Rosie dead. More so, the color contrast in this scene is insane. First of all, the contrast of the blue butterfly against the grey town center. Then the camera follows the butterfly, which completely changes the vibe of the scene. The callback to Jojo staring at Rosie’s shoes at eye level as they walk along the river as he finds her hanging, shoes at eye level, is monumental and emotionally raw. Again, the color contrast is not only prominent, but beautiful. Rosie’s bright red shoes are in stark contrast to the bleak colors of the square. The bleak colors of the square represent the immense emotional blow Jojo was dealt. Finally, the scene is concluded by scanning of the attic windows, further layering. The windows, which personifies bitter and mournful eyes, subtly refer to Elsa’s hiding as well as loudly claiming the depressing reality. The windows are broken alongside Jojo. Waititi is a mastermind.
* The final scene of Jojo and Elsa dancing is light and beautiful. I loved how we got single shots of both of them dancing. It shows the finality and resolution of the movie.

## Final Consensus

As my favorite movie from 2019, and coming in at a strong 9.5, I strongly recommend watching Jojo Rabbit if you have not seen it. Jojo is one of the most successful, enjoyable, and enthralling multi-dimensional movies I have seen. A must watch. Furthermore, the multi-layers and implications of certain characters and plot mechanisms prove Waititi’s genius. Waititi confirmed previous notions that he can create a hilarious comedy, but also proved he can make a compelling drama. More so, Waititi is not dismissive of the horrendous suffering amidst the Holocaust, but makes a definitive statement. Conclusively, Waititi’s directing is complimented by phenomenal acting and stupendous cinematography.
