# **Overview**

**Director**: Adam McKay.

**Notable** **Cast**: Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Steve Carell, and Sam Rockwell.

**Release** **Year**: 2018.

 

# **Synopsis**

Vice is a dramatized biography of Vice President Dick Cheney. Director Adam McKay starts the tale early in Cheney’s life and portrays his introduction to politics and sees it through his term as Vice President. Throughout the film, McKay sprinkles in various of Cheney’s personal relationships, dynamics, and events, which offer additional layers. Similar to McKay’s The Big Short, Vice possesses a strong political agenda. 

 

# **Acting**

Vice is definitely on par for the performances I have come to expect from Christian Bale at this point. It is truly incredible how devoted this guy is to embody every aspect of his character. Not only did Bale put on hundreds of pounds (which he immediately dropped for Ford vs. Ferrari – he’s insane) for this role, he also learned and mimicked Cheney’s voice and cadence. I mean the impression is not perfect, but wow Bale really did a good job with Cheney’s growly manner of speech. 

 

Amy Adams plays a compelling Lynne Cheney. Adams is a massive driving force for Bale throughout the entire movie. Adams does an amazing job of being not only stern and confrontational, but also supportive. At times where Bale does not seem as driven or calculated, Adams picks up the slack. Adams’ emotionally void response to her daughter coming out of the closet as well as pressuring Bale to accept the role of Vice President are great examples. Adams is ruthless and powerful in this role.

 

Steve Carell does not have a lot of screen time in this movie, but McKay expertly uses his character, Donald Rumsfeld, as a point of reference and comparison for Bale’s character progression. Carell is originally Bale’s mentor and first guide into the wild frontier of American politics. Bale is originally seen as young, hungry, and a bit clueless. Profoundly noted when he asked Carell, “What exactly do we believe?” I think this scene is also a slight diss at Republican ideology. During the beginning of their relationship Bale is but the apprentice, and Carell is the cold, calculating, ruthless politician. McKay uses this relationship to show how Bale was molded and shaped by Carell. However, after Carell returns from Europe and serves under Rockwell with Bale, it is apparent that the relational dynamic has flipped. Bale now possesses more agency, displayed when Carell remarks that Bale has become more ruthless. In the latter half of the movie, I really noticed that Bale had surpassed Carell. I really enjoyed this multi-purposed relationship.

 

I love Sam Rockwell, so I was upset that his role in Vice was pretty minor; however, I think Rockwell did a very good job of portraying Bush. More so, Rockwell executed well in the role McKay had for Bush, that of being a pawn in the Cheney system. The combination of McKay’s writing and Rockwell’s acting made it very believable, to me, that Bush did not have much agency and Cheney pulled the strings (this is what McKay is trying to prove lol). Again, it is important when analyzing this movie to acknowledge the political motivation, which means McKay’s interpretation of President Bush may not be fully accurate. Anyways, I still appreciated Rockwell’s rendition, even while factoring in this motive. I think he did a great job seeming aloof and more so willing to pass the responsibility to Cheney. Rockwell’s Bush also acts somewhat as a foil for Bale’s Cheney. Rockwell’s lack of understanding and comprehension of Bale’s motives further extenuates Bale’s presentation of Cheney as maniacal, controlling, and manipulative. McKay uses Rockwell to really exemplify Bale’s controlling and manipulative behaviors. It is important to view this dynamic with the insight that McKay is portraying this relationship through his own bias. 

 

# **Cinematography**

I was extremely excited for this movie from the time I first heard about it until it finally came out in theaters Christmas of 2018. I loved The Big Short, so I was ecstatic when I heard that McKay was embarking on another historical / political project. McKay presented an extremely unique directing style in The Big Short, which he continued in Vice; however, I feel as though The Big Short was better executed in this aspect.

 

McKay introduces key plot points in such a unique and profound way, which I really liked about Vice. The movie is weird, but I like weird so whatever. McKay goes full on Shakespeare as he dramatized the hypothetical conversation between Bale and Adams that resulted in Bale acceptance of Rockwell’s offer. The scene is extremely off pace and out of left field, but it works really well! Furthermore, it is crazy to watch Bale, Adams, and the sound production instantly transition to Elizabethan English. I thought the scene worked very well. McKay knew that conversation was never recorded, so he took artistic liberty in how he portrayed it. I liked it. Some may feel as though it was forced or awkward, but I think that was also McKay’s intent. 

 

McKay again demonstrates his unique layering technique in the steakhouse scene. McKay layers the expansion of the torture program under the Bush administration with Bale and his entourage at a steakhouse. The scene is extremely well constructed with the visual imagery of the gothic artwork and the overlay of the waiter reading the menu specials as different torture techniques and political loopholes. Like the majority of this movie, the scene is extremely biased and politically charged; however, McKay executes well on his technique and does a superb job in proving his thesis. I think McKay does well here though because the scene is very jarring. Especially because of the manner of the conversation, the ideas are so casually addressed. Likewise, to The Big Short, McKay uses this scene to make a complex idea more accessible and digestible for the audience. I personally like that he does this, but to each their own.

 

There are a couple of scenes where McKay overlays a main plot point and a personal anecdote from Cheney’s life that really amplify what McKay is trying to say. The exposition of Bale fly fishing as he accepts the offer to be Vice President is extremely well done in production, execution, and storytelling. As the conversation progresses and Bale tests his expanded desired responsibilities as Vice President, McKay continues to cut to Bale fly fishing. The conversation starts with a slightly bobbing tackle, I was really blown away by the metaphor. The comparison is exemplified by the soft, but ever increasing and accelerating sound of a reeling rod as Rockwell is drawn deeper and deeper into the ploy. The scene climaxes beautifully as Rockwell agrees to Bale’s propositions, which happens as McKay cuts to a fish being successfully hooked. I loved this scene, my favorite in the movie. 

 

Even though I believe The Big Short was better in this regard, Vice was still entertaining and captivating. I particularly enjoyed when McKay played with alternate history and faux rolled the credits halfway through the movie as Bale was faced with his first real chance to escape the political game. I have never seen anyone roll the credits halfway through a movie! More so, McKay’s use of a narrator, Kurt (played by Jesse Plemons) was extremely interesting, I was a huge fan. The bird’s-eye-view narration was super pertinent and poignant in how McKay told the story. Furthermore, I loved how McKay revealed the narrator’s connection to Bale. I even jumped the second time as Plemons was struck by a car. I think this entire scene was super well tied in with the overarching plot of the story. Plemons is struck by the car as Bale is in surgery after another heart attack; Bale was originally going to die unless he had emergency heart surgery. The transition and tie in were so seamless. The mixing of Plemons’s narration, the heart surgery, and the beating heart in the background created a very stressful climax. Well done, McKay.

 

Vice concludes as Bale breaks the fourth wall and directly addresses the audience. I think McKay did a fantastic job with the transition in this scene. The scene starts with Bale walking in for an interview. Then, after the reporter asks a question, Bale turns to the camera to address the audience. The final scene of the movie was definitely hit or miss for people (a miss for me). Furthermore, here McKay openly reveals his political leanings and intentions for the movie. I, personally, was a little annoyed by the message that the scene presented, it came off as redundant. The entire movie is essentially proving that Bale was self-motivated, immoral, manipulative, power- mongering, and created a whole lot of damage for the American people and the Middle East. I thought McKay successfully proved his thesis throughout the movie, which makes this last scene, where Bale defends his actions, unnecessary. Furthermore, you need to take the entire message of Vice with a grain of salt. If you watch the movie, go into it fully aware that it is biased and politically motivated. That factor may very well shape how you enjoy the movie. 

 

# Final **Consensus**

Vice is a highly politically motivated dramatization of the story of Dick Cheney. Maybe I came into this movie with way too high of expectations, which is why I feel a little bit let down. It is a good movie, I’m not trying to insinuate it isn’t; however, it is not a return to form for McKay. Watch the movie, but also don’t drop everything in order to do so. Vice’s style, story, and production is not nearly as good as The Big Short. It was not as entertaining and was much slower. But, Vice is still incredibly unique, engaging, and entertaining. I left the movie, both times, feeling heavy and convicted about America’s role as a world power. I think McKay wanted the viewer to really consider the impact America had in the early 2000s, and for me, he achieved this goal. More so, the acting from Bale, Adams, and Carell is also a positive for this movie. I wish Rockwell had more of a role, but that’s just because I’m a Rockwell fan! I would recommend watching Vice, but it doesn’t need to be the top of your list either!
